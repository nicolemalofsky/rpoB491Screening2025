Research data with associated data analysis, figures, and tables for this report are divided into subfolders related to either the "Main Report", "Supporting Information", or features "All-Encompassing" information. 


There are four "Main Report" folders:

(1) "Main Report - Andre Assay Data Repository" includes all raw data files, analyzed data files, experimental protocol sheets, and instrument run files associated with data collection for the Andre I491F assay using the QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR instrument. The aforementioned data is sorted into subfolders for each independent experiment contributing to N=3 independent experiments on the QuantStudio 5. Outside the subfolders (but still within the "Main Report" folder) is the analyzed data summary across those 3 independent experiments. 

(2) The two folders "Main Report - SMASH Assay QuantStudio Data Repository Part 1 of 2" and (3) "Main Report - SMASH Assay QuantStudio Data Repository Part 2 of 2" together include all raw data files, analyzed data files, experimental protocol sheets, and instrument run files associated with data collection for the SMASH I491 diagnostic using the QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR instrument. The aforementioned data is sorted into subfolders for each independent experiment contributing to N=6 independent experiments on the QuantStudio 5. Outside the subfolders (but still within the "Part 2 of 2" "Main Report" folder) is the analyzed data summary across those 6 independent experiments. 

(4) "Main Report - SMASH Assay Rotor-Gene Data Repository" includes all raw data files, analyzed data files, experimental protocol sheets, and instrument run files associated with data collection for the SMASH I491 diagnostic using the Rotor-Gene Q real-time PCR instrument. The aforementioned data is sorted into subfolders for each independent experiment contributing to N=6 independent experiments on the Rotor-Gene Q. Outside the subfolders (but still within the "Main Report" folder) is the analyzed data summary across those 6 independent experiments. 


There are two "Supporting Information" folders:

(1) "Supporting Information - Selecting Susceptible Melt Probe Sequence Data Repository" includes all raw data files, analyzed data files, experimental protocol sheets, oligo sequence mapping, and instrument run files associated with data collection for the supplemental characterization and sequence design studies for the susceptible melt probe using the QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR instrument. The aforementioned data is sorted into one subfolder for the independent experiment contributing to N=1 independent experiments on the QuantStudio 5. 

(2) "Supporting Information - Adjusting Probe Concentration for Melt Alignment Data Repository" includes all raw data files, analyzed data files, experimental protocol sheets, and instrument run files associated with data collection for the supplemental tuning studies for the susceptible melt probe concentration using the QuantStudio 5 real-time PCR instrument. The aforementioned data is sorted into subfolders for the two independent experiments contributing to the data set.


There are two "All-Encompassing" folders:

(1) "All-Encompassing - Figures' includes all image files for the figures included in the report. 

(2) "All-Encompassing - Prism File for Data Analysis, Statistics, Figure Making" includes the Prism program file used to perform statistical data analysis and make figures included in the report.
